We downloaded java on our computure and learned how to test to see if it's installed successfully by inputing "javac -version"
We practiced compiling and running a java program by running a Sinewave stored in the file renamed as "Compsci"
  - cd Documents
  - cd CompSci
  - javac SineWave.java
  - java SineWave

We started writing our own program and run it on our computer. 
The program is the one shown below:
  public class FirstProg
  {
  	public static void main(String[] args )
  	{
	   	System.out.println("Iâ€™m very cool.");
  	}
  }
The way how I run this program is same as 8/17. cd Documents/GitHub/BasicsAndPrinting/FirstProg , javac FirstProg.java , java FirstProg

public: anyone can access it
static: Use to group classes together and to access the primitie membre of the enclosing class through the object reference. 
void: Method does not return to anything.
